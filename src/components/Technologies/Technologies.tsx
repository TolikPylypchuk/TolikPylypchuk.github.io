        <Emphasis>C#</Emphasis> is my language of choice for almost all my
        personal projects. This is the first language that I&apos;ve learned
        when I was still in school and I continue using it regularly to this
        day. I&apos;ve developed projects with a wide variety of frameworks
        inluding WPF, Avalonia, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, Entity Framework, etc.
        I&apos;ve tried creating this website using Blazor, but it just
        doesn&apos;t work well at all for semi-static websites like portfolios.

        never use Java for personal projects. At work I develop mostly with the
