# Portfolio

Hi, I'm Tolik Pylypchuk and this is my portfolio website. It's currently under construction, so hang tight for updates.

## Why Blazor

As you may have noticed, this web-site is written with [Blazor](https://blazor.net). I've chosen it for one reason and
one reason only: to flex my skills. I realise that using Blazor for simple static portfolio sites is a horrible idea and
definitely overkill. I simply don't care at the moment. Maybe one day I'll rewrite it to be lighter.
